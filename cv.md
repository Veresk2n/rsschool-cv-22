### About myself:

I used to work as a teacher of English, as an interpreter in the sphere of aircraft maintenance, an HR specialist. At the moment I don't work because I have to stay at home with a little kid. I have always been interested in programming, even at school where we learnt Turbo Pascal. However, I considered this sphere too complicated for me, but really interesting. I hope to learn more about web-development and Front-End in _RSSchool_.

### Code example:

````function myFunction(login) {
    //напишите ниже ваш код
    if (login == "admin") {
        console.log("Администрирование, Операции, Статистика, Роли.");
    } else if (login == "support") {
        console.log("Операции, Статистика.");
    } else if (login == "user") {
        console.log("Статистика.");
    } else {console.log("Неверный логин")}}
    ```
